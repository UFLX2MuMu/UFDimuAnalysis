Some miscellaneous tools to help with different things.

*EventTools
  - mostly has tools to input event info from csv or output event info to csv

* PUTools
  - make the PU histos for MC samples required for pileup reweighting

* ParticleTools
  - mostly tools to deal with gen muons
  - these probably wouldn't be necessary if we saved the gen muons in a better way
